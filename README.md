<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

When verifying the performance of neural networks, the issues of interpretability (interpreting), explainability (explaining) or understanding of artificial intelligence systems are raised. The latter is most often defined as the ability to characterize the model's behavior, its functioning, without penetrating the internal structure.

**Interpretability** - how easy it is for a person to understand why the model made a particular decision, i.e. assigned a specific label to the data being classified. In the case of images or texts, this concept can be defined as the mapping of the model's prediction (i.e., an abstract label, concept) to a known set of input data - pixels or separate words. 

**Explanation**  - a set of features from the interpreted domain, on the basis of which a decision was made. A graphical representation of such an explanation can be, for example, a heat map (HM), also known as an attention map. It provides a visual representation of which regions of the image have the greatest influence on a given classification, i.e. the assignment of a selected label by the model

### Dataset

Dataset source:
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5p7fxjt7vs/1

The analyzed data was recorded with a DUB SkinSkanner 75 camera and originally had dimensions of 2067 by 1555 pixels. The images were from both the areas lesions, as well as from healthy forearm skin in the case of the control group. Based on the segmented areas of epidermis, tumor lesions and SLEB layer were then used to obtain skin layer maps, used in the subsequent analysis of the focus areas of models taught to recognize selected classes on HFUS images.

### Models

Four architectures, often used in medical image analysis issues, were selected for the study. The selected models are:
- DenseNet201
- GoogLeNet
- MobileNet v2 
- ResNet101

A k-fold cross-validation (k=5) was applied during the study. All images had a target size of 224 Ã— 224 pixels. 

Transfer learning (ImageNet dataset) and also data augmentation (rotation and reflection in the vertical axis) were applied. 

### Saliency methods

Choosen saliency methods can be divided as below:

|                         | **general maps** | **detailed maps**                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **based on gradients**  | EigenGrad-CAM    | GradientShap                                      |
|                         | Grad-CAM         | Integrated Gradients                              |
|                         | Grad-CAM++       | Saliency                                          |
|                         | HiRes-CAM        |                                                   |
| **not using gradients** | Ablation-CAM     | Occlusion (detail will depend on the window used) |
|                         | Score-CAM        |                                                   |

### Saliency based evaluation
The selected evaluation criteria, determined by the performance of the model on the test set, take into account:
- correct localization of areas by the model, as determined by the Hit Rate parameter,
- proper identification of details in the image, determined by the coverage of the heat map and skin layer map,
- the performance of the model on the test set.

Localization ability was assessed by the Hit Rate, which determines the hits of the peak of the relevance map to the relevant regions of the skin layer map. The calculation method took into account gradual changes in the importance of regions and scored hits on a scale of 3 to -1. It also partially rewarded in this way the focus of the model on regions below the most important area:

The resolution of the model was determined by the degree to which it focuses on the most important elements of the image. It was determined in two ways, based directly on the heat map and on the masks generated from it. 

In addition, the reliability of the method itself was also analyzed, that is, determining how much the generated attention map can be trusted. This was described by two coefficients - Drop in Confidence (DiC) and Increase in Confidence (IiC). 

Two methods were used to cover pixels in the original images:
- darkening by applying a heat map to the image,
- pixel zeroing by applying a binary mask obtained from thresholding the map

| **orginal image**   | **the most important parts covered** | **non-essential elements covered**                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ![org](https://github.com/annasli378/SaliencyCNNAnalysis/blob/main/images/pewniosci_obr_org.png)| ![import](https://github.com/annasli378/SaliencyCNNAnalysis/blob/main/images/pewniosci_obr_zakr_wazne_hm.png)| ![nonimport](https://github.com/annasli378/SaliencyCNNAnalysis/blob/main/images/pewniosci_obr_zakr_nw_hm.png)       |

A decrease in the confidence of the classification of the changed area indicates that most likely the heat map or mask has covered most of the area relevant for classification. If confidence has not dropped, the HM or mask does not provide full information about the area on which the model is focused on. There is also the possibility that after removing the area in question, the remaining portion is enough to make a good classification, for example, if the mask is too small. If classification confidence does not increase after removing insignificant areas, it may be due to the method covering too much area or it may be due to the fact that the attention map does not give full information about the focus areas.

### Summary

In order to evaluate the learned models, their performance was tested on a test set of 126 samples:
| model | accuracy [%] | precision [%]  | recall [%]  | f1-score [%]  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DenseNet201  | 96.03  | 96.02  | 96.03  |  95.90  |
| GoogLeNet | 95.24  | 95.65  | 95.24  | 94.87 |
| MobileNet v2  | 94.44  | 94.99  | 94.44  | 93.92 |
| ResNet101 | 95.28  | 95.25  | 95.28  | 95.10  |
